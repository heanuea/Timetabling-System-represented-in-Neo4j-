# Timetabling-System-represented-in-Neo4j

## Introduction

This project is mostly a documentation detailing the design of the database and prototype Neo4j database using data from GMIT Timetable.
The database should store information and relationships about student groups, classrooms, lecturers, and work hours – just like the currently used timetabling system at GMIT. The document will show the full design and decisions i made as to what data is represtended for example what Nodes, labels and relationships are represting that data.


####Tools Used

  - Neo4j IDE (discription below)
  - Cypher Query Languge
  - NotePad
  - Internet(main resource in reserch)

#What is NEO4j

  - Neo4j is a graph DataBase 
  - It is Acid, all data modifications is downloaded within a transaction. Transactional processing ensures data reliability.
  - It is implemented in Java( works on any platform).
  - Comes with Enterprises features this means it can scaleup as well as scale out.
  - It is comfertable with Billions of Entities. 
  - It has a restful APi. 
  - No Schema needed. 

  
#What is Cypher Language 
  
  - Works on the Cypher (Query Language made for Neo4j)
  -Cypher is a declarative, SQL-inspired language for describing patterns in graphs visually using an [ascii-art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) syntax.
  -It allows us to state what we want to select, insert, update or delete from our graph data without requiring us to describe exactly how to do it.
  
  - Down below shows a Relationship between two Nodes.
